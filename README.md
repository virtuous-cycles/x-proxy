# X-Proxy

X-Proxy is an API for simplifying X (formerly Twitter) requests for a single authenticated account. This project provides a set of endpoints that wrap around the X API, making it easier to interact with X's features programmatically. While the server is running it should take care of authentication token refreshing.

## API Endpoints

### Overview

This section covers the API routes implemented using Flask in this project. These routes include functionalities to get tweets, search for tweets, post tweets, ~~manage draft tweets~~, pull mentions, follow users, and unfollow users. Authentication is handled using a token.

### Authentication

All routes are protected and require an Authorization header with a bearer token. The token is validated against the `API_SECRET_KEY` set in your environment variables.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10 or higher
-   Poetry (for dependency management)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/virtuous-cycles/x-proxy.git
    cd x-proxy
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    poetry install --no-root
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    - Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file:
        ```
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    - Open the `.env` file and fill in the necessary environment variables as defined in `config.py`. The `.env.example` file provides a template with placeholder values for all required variables.

### Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```
poetry run python main.py
```

## Project Structure

The X-Proxy project is organized into several key directories and files:

-   `api/`: Contains route definitions and API logic

    -   `__init__.py`: Initializes the API blueprint and imports all route modules
    -   Individual route modules (e.g., `get_tweet_route.py`, `post_tweet_route.py`, etc.)

-   `services/`: Houses service classes for interacting with X API and other functionalities

    -   `x_service.py`: Handles interactions with the X (Twitter) API
    -   `airtable_service.py`: Manages operations with Airtable
    -   `combined_services.py`: Coordinates operations involving both X and Airtable
    -   `oauth_setup.py`: Sets up and validates OAuth for X API
    -   `media_service.py`: Handles media-related operations (upload, download)
    -   `process_x_response.py`: Processes and enriches X API responses
    -   `tweet_service.py`: Provides specific tweet-related functionalities
    -   `oauth2_handler.py`: Manages OAuth2 authentication and token refresh
    -   `oauth1_handler.py`: Handles OAuth1 authentication
    -   `rate_limit_handler.py`: Implements rate limiting for X API requests

-   `config.py`: Contains configuration settings and environment variable management

-   `main.py`: Main application entry point, sets up the Flask app and services

-   `error_handlers.py`: Defines custom error handlers for the application

-   `.env.example`: Template for required environment variables

-   `pyproject.toml`: Defines project dependencies and configuration for Poetry

-   `README.md`: Project documentation and setup instructions

-   `api.md`: Detailed API documentation

The project follows a modular structure, separating concerns into different directories and files:

1. API routes are defined in the `api/` directory, with each endpoint having its own file.
2. Business logic and external service interactions are encapsulated in the `services/` directory.
3. Configuration is centralized in `config.py`, pulling from environment variables.
4. The main application setup and running logic is in `main.py`.
5. Dependencies and project metadata are managed through `pyproject.toml` using Poetry.

This structure promotes maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns, making it easier to extend and modify the project as needed.
